# Population Genetics: Project Showcase

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my repository, where I’m showcasing the projects I've completed during my Masters program in a course on Population Genetics.

## 🌱 Course Overview
This course serves as a beginner-friendly introduction to Population Genetics, a significant branch of evolutionary biology focusing on the genetic structure of populations and its evolution over time. Throughout the course, we delve deep into various evolutionary processes like mutation, natural selection, genetic drift, inbreeding, recombination, and gene flow to understand the genetic composition and evolutionary trajectories of natural populations.

### 🎯 Objectives
By the end of this course, I aimed to:
- Grasp and apply fundamental concepts of population genetics.
- Conduct phylogenetic population genetic analyses.
- Draw inferences about populations from population scale, whole genome resequencing data.

## 🚀 Projects
Here, you’ll find an assortment of projects, each exploring different aspects and concepts of Population Genetics. Feel free to explore them, drop a star ⭐ if you like them, and share your thoughts or ask any questions via issues!
